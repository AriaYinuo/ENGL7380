Missing from the dataset:
1. Some newspaper records related are missed. The dataset is a collection of state-level newspaper preservation projects, the primary object of which is historical newspapers. This can leave many newspapers with limited distribution, especially those that were only distributed in the Chinese community in the early days and had a small audience, excluded or forgotten.
2. It is difficult to keep track of the presence of Chinese elements in non-Chinese newspapers. Language and newspaper titles are the only features that can determine whether a Chinese element is present in the newspaper. A significant proportion of Chinese participation in the US newspaper sector is in other non-Chinese newspapers, such as being the subject or author of a story, and this data cannot be captured due to a lack of relevant data in the dataset.
3. the lack of data on the circulation and range of circulation of Chinese newspapers. Combining the number of Chinese newspapers through circulation and circulation range would give a more accurate picture of the development of Chinese community newspapers, but both data are difficult to obtain.

Areas that could be remedied:
1. search for uncatalogued Chinese newspapers by other means. Through the Chinese or Asian Historic Preservation Project, we have access to a number of newspapers that are not included in Chronicling America, which would enable a more complete data source.
2. a side-by-side look at influence through years of circulation. If a newspaper has only been in circulation for one year, or even just one issue, we can presume that the newspaper's influence is very limited. However, if a newspaper has been in circulation for a long time, we can assume that the newspaper is popular in the area.
